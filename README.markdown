#ThunderBolt-NG

##What is ThunderBolt-NG?
ThunderBolt-NG is a lightweight logger extension for Flex 2-4 and Flash ActionScript 3 applications and a fork of the ThunderBoltAS3 project.

It has been almost completely rewritten. Out of the box, it supports logging to the browser console and flashlog.txt. The external api has hardly changed.
